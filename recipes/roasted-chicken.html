        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> I love a good roasted chicken,  this is one of my favourite from reknowned chef Julia Child. Goes great with so many sides and tastes delicious </p>

        <h1> Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
           <li>2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
           <li>1/3 cup finely diced carrots</li>
           <li>1/3 cup finely diced onion</li>
           <li>1/3 cup finely diced celery</li>
           <li>1 teaspooon thyme, savory, or mixed herbs, or 2 fresh thyme or savory sprigs</li>
           <li>1 chicken</li>
           <li>kosher salt</li>
           <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
           <li>Fresh flat-lear parsley stems</li>
           <li>Celery leaves</li>
           <li>6 lemon slices, 1/8 inch thick</li>
           <li>1/2 cup sliced onion</li>
           <li>1/2 cup sliced carrots</li>
           <li>  tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
           <li>3/4 cup chick stock or broth</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h1> Directions</h1>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet. Add the diced carrots, onion, and celery and cook over moderate heat until softened. Stir in the herbs and set aside.</li> 
           <li>If desired, cut out and discard the wishbone. Pull the neck skin up over the chicken breast and secure it to the back with a toothpick. Salt and pepper the cavity and spoon in the cooked vegetables, a handful of parsley stems and celery leaves, and the lemon slices. Massage the chicken all over with 1 tablespoon of the butter, then truss it. Alternatively, tie drumstick ends together and tuck wings under the body.</li>
           <li>Choose a flameproof roasting pan that is about 1 inch larger than the chicken and place a rack inside. Salt the chicken all over and set it breast-side up on the rack. (Thoroughly wash all surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with the raw chicken.)</li>
           <li>Roast the chicken for 15 minutes and then brush with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter. Scatter the sliced onion and carrot all around. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F.</li>
           <li>Roast for 45 minutes, and then brush the lemon juice over the chicken. If necessary, add 1/2 cup of water to the vegetables to prevent burning.</li>
           <li>Roast for 1 hour and baste the chicken with pan juices. Test for doneness; drumsticks should move easily in their sockets and their flesh should feel somewhat soft. If not, continue roasting, basting and testing every 7 to 8 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F.</li>
           <li>Spear the chicken through the shoulders and lift to drain; if juices run clear yellow, the chicken is done. Let the chicken rest on a carving board for 15 minutes; discard the string.</li>
           <li>Spoon all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the juices in the pan. Add the stock and boil until lightly syrupy, 5 minutes. Strain; you will have just enough to bathe each serving with a fragrant spoonful.</li>

        </ol>
